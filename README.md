# Real_estate_Investment_Bot
Craigslist Crawler

## Goal
Build a tool to find properties with the highest ROI, based on the cost of renting vs. purchase cost in that area.

### Complete
* Scrapes all of Oregon, but is capabable of scraping all of the US with a few parameter changes
**It takes roughly 6 hours to scape Oregon currently**

### Left to Add
* Interactive visulizations
* Decrease run time
* Further clean DATA

## Current Results 
* The data from Oregon Craigslist rental and home, is extremely dirty. The data doesn't allow for my orignal idea, to find the top ROI properties. However I have found useful information on big picture questions like, which zipcodes are best to invest in?
**Further Analysis Needed**
